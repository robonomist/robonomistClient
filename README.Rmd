# Robonomist Client <a href='https://robonomist.com'><img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="138.5" /></a>

The `robonomistClient` package is a powerful R client designed to simplify access to diverse datasets hosted on the Robonomist Data Server. With seamless integration, the package enables analysts, researchers, and developers to retrieve and analyze up-to-date, multilingual data from numerous national and international sources, all in a tidy format ready for analysis.

## Key Features

The robonomistClient package is designed to deliver:

**Comprehensive Data Coverage**

Access data from national statistical agencies, international organizations, and regional sources—all in one place. This means less time spent searching for data and more time for analysis.

* Statistics Finland, OECD, World Bank, European Central Bank, and more.

**High Data Fidelity and Trust**

Our data is reliable and accurately reflects the information from official statistical agencies. Complete metadata is provided for every dataset to ensure that your analysis is based on credible information.

* Full transparency on data sources.
* Detailed metadata included.

**Flexibility in Data Retrieval**

Customize the way data is retrieved to fit your specific needs:

* Multilingual support
* Choose between variable labels or codes.
* Interpret time variables as dates or raw values.

**Seamless Integration for Dynamic Workflows**

Designed to work smoothly with R, robonomistClient makes building dynamic documents and automatically updating apps easier by providing a stable API:

* Reduce disruptions caused by changing official statistics APIs.
* Focus on insights rather than wrangling with data inconsistencies.

## Datasources

The `robonomistClient` package provides seamless and efficient access to a wide range of datasources via the Robonomist Data Server. With support for **`r format(nrow(distinct(data(), id)), big.mark = " ")`** up-to-date data tables across `r nrow(datasources())` distinct datasources and `r length(unique(unlist(datasources()$languages)))` languages, the package is designed to streamline your data analysis workflow.

**International Datasources**

* **Global Institutions**: OECD, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Statistical Database (UNECE), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
* **European Union**: Eurostat, European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB).
* **Nordic Countries**: Statistics Sweden, Swedish National Institute of Economic Research, Swedish Agricultural Agency, Statistics Norway, Statistics Denmark, Statistics Iceland, Statistics Estonia, Nordic Statistics Database.

**Finnish Datasources**

* **Statistics Finland**: StatFin, StatFin archive databases, Municipal figures & financial data, Paavo postal code area statistics, experimental statistics, immigrants and integration database.
* **Regional Data**: Helsingin seudun aluesarjat -tilastotietokanta, Helsingin ympäristötilasto.
* **National Agencies**: Finnish Tax Administration, Finnish Centre for Pensions, Natural Resources Institute Finland (LUKE), Traficom (Finnish Transport and Communications Agency), Customs Finland, THL Sotkanet, Vipunen (Education Statistics Finland), Fingrid, TutkiHallintoa.fi (Valtiokonttori).

**Thematic & Specialized Datasources**

* **Energy & Environment**: Entso-E Transparency Platform, U.S. Energy Information Administration database, Fingrid.
* **Financial**: Deutsche Bundesbank time series database, FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data**.
* **Health & Pandemic Data**: THL Epirapo, ECDC.

This list highlights just some of the many datasources available through the `robonomistClient package`. The package also includes **Robonomist's curated tidy data tables**, providing ready-to-use datasets tailored for streamlined analysis and insight generation.

## Getting started

To setup a Robonomist Data Server for your organization, please contact <team@robonomist.com>.

### 1. Install the Package

First, install the package from GitHub (if you haven't already):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools if necessary
# install.packages("devtools")

# Install the latest version of robonomistClient from GitHub
devtools::install_github("robonomist/robonomistClient")
```

### 2. Set Up Your Connection

To start using the package, you need to set the hostname of your Robonomist Data Server and provide an access token. Use the set `robonomist_server()` function to establish the connection.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(robonomistClient)
options(
  robonomistClient.datasources_print_n = 10,
  robonomistClient.search_print_n = 10
)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(robonomistClient)

# Set up the connection
set_robonomist_server(hostname = "hostname.com", access_token = "abc")
```

### 3. Explore Available Datasources

To see which datasources are available, use the `datasources()` function. This will give you an overview of all the datasources you can access.
```{r}
datasources()
```

### 4. Search and Retrieve Data Tables

The `data()` function allows you to search and retrieve data tables from the datasources. Here’s how to list all available data tables:

```{r}
data()
```

* Search for tables related to employment:
  ```{r}
  data("Employment")
  ```
* Search for a specific dataset with language options:
  ```{r}
  data("StatFin/ntp", lang = "en")
  ```

These search capabilities help you quickly locate the data you need without needing to know exact IDs.

### 5. Retrieve a Specific Data Table

If you know the ID of a specific data table you want, you can retrieve it by passing the ID to the `data()` function. For example:

```{r}
data("StatFin/synt/statfin_synt_pxt_12dx.px")
```

#### Retrieve Data for Production Use

The `data_get()` function is designed for production use cases where robustness is crucial. It allows you to fetch a specific dataset by its ID directly, without any searching. This ensures consistency, especially in automated scripts or applications where you need to reliably retrieve the same dataset over time.

```{r}
# Fetch a specific dataset using its ID for production use
production_data <- data_get("StatFin/synt/statfin_synt_pxt_12dx.px")
```


#### Fetch Data Directly Using a URL

You can also fetch data directly using a link from the datasource’s website using `fetch_data_from_url()`. This is useful when you have a specific URL from a datasource explorer, such as the OECD's data explorer:

```{r}
fetch_data_from_url("https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?tm=sna&pg=0&fs[0]=Measure%2C0%7CAquaculture%20production%23AQUA_PD%23&fc=Measure&snb=1&vw=tb&df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_FISH_PROD%40DF_FISH_AQUA&df[ag]=OECD.TAD.ARP&df[vs]=1.0&pd=2010%2C&dq=.A.._T.T&ly[rw]=REF_AREA&ly[cl]=TIME_PERIOD&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false")
```
